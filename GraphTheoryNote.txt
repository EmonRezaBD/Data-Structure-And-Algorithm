1. Handshaking Lemma:

we use 2 hands for handshake
so, 
case-1: If we draw an edge from even degree node to even degree node then 2 odd degree nodes will insrease
case-2: If we draw an edge from odd degree node to odd degree node than 2 odd degree nodes will decrease
case-3: If we dwar and edge from odd to even degree node, then no of odd degree nodes will remain same

So, It is increasing or decreasing by 2. Thats why it is called handshaking lemma.

Sum od total degree = 2*no of edge
